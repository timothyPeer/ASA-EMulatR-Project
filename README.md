# Virtual Alpha Platform

An open-source, cross-platform **Virtual Alpha platform** designed to emulate the Alpha architecture and support legacy operating systems including **OpenVMS**, **Unix/Tru64**, and **Alpha-Linux**.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the Alpha experience on modern hardware by implementing a virtual Alpha platform that runs on any architecture supported by the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/).

Having spent decades as a DBA, Systems Administrator, and Software Engineer working on OpenVMS and Digital/Oracle technologies, this is my way of giving back to the community — and raising awareness of these remarkable platforms and the brilliant engineering behind them.

---

## 🎯 Goals

✅ Open-source and freely available  
✅ Cross-platform (thanks to Qt)  
✅ Faithful to the Alpha architecture  
✅ Support for OpenVMS, Tru64 UNIX, and Alpha-Linux  
✅ A platform for enthusiasts, historians, and engineers to explore and contribute
