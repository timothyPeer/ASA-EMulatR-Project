Group			Action Needed
Missing			Integer Special Ops (AMASK, IMPLVER)	Should be added
Missing			Memory Hints (FETCH, MB2)	Optional but good for accuracy
Missing			Trap Controls (TRAPB)	Must add for full correct trap handling
RPCC			Should add if cycle counters needed
Extended		VAX FP	Optional if you fully support G_FLOAT conversions

ChatGPT:  (How to incorporate and how is there value in having it?)
✅ I can show you how to create an Exception Vector Table map (e.g., 0x100 → handler, 0x180 → handler)?
I can help you generate default handler functions at each vector address (like pal_arithmetic_trap(), pal_illegal_instruction(), etc)?
✅ Or show how to build a dynamic PC Handler Table to dispatch automatically based on

 I can generate a stub AlphaKernelExceptionHandler.S (assembler-like) file showing how the kernel handlers could look at 0x100, 0x180, 0x200?
